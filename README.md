# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Prime vs Netflix Tweets Using NLP + Tableau Visualization

## Overview
This project performs a comparative sentiment analysis of Amazon Prime and Netflix tweets using NLP techniques and visual storytelling. The objective was to understand public perception, sentiment polarity, and subjectivity between two major streaming platforms.

## Key Findings
- Both platforms generated high user engagement (>10k tweets in a single day)
- Amazon Prime tweets showed comparatively more **positive** and less **subjective** sentiment
- Behavioral patterns across users remained generally similar across both platforms

## Methodology
- Data Extraction (Twitter)
- NLP Preprocessing (tokenizing, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Sentiment & subjectivity scoring
- Word cloud generation to reveal prominent terms
- Tableau dashboards for comparison and insight visualization

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: NLP preprocessing + sentiment scoring + word clouds
- **Tableau**: Visualization + comparative dashboards
- **NLP Libraries**: Text preprocessing + polarity scoring

## Research Limitations
- Analysis reflects only the period during which tweets were collected
- Sentiment may fluctuate due to releases, events, or marketing
- Findings may vary with larger datasets and longer time horizons

## Visualizations
Screenshots of Tableau dashboards and wordclouds are included in the `figures/` directory.

## Files Included
- Jupyter notebook for NLP and sentiment analysis
- CSVs of processed tweet data (if permissible)
- Tableau workbook (.twbx)
- Word cloud images
- README documentation
